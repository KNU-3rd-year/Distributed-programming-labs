# Lab 5
**Topic**: barriers

## Part 1:
### Task:
**Topic:**
Using an independent implementation of the synchronizer

**Task:**
Assignment about new recruits. Many recruits are given the command "to the left"
or "to the right". All recruits try to carry out the order, but the problem is
because they don't know where the right is and where the left is. 
Therefore, each recruit turns either to the right or to the left. 
If the new recruit turns around and sees that his neighbor is standing with his back to him, 
he believes that he has done everything right. If they come face to face, 
then both believe that they were mistaken and turn 180 degrees. 
Create a multi-threaded application that simulates the behavior of multiple recruits until it reaches a steady state. 
The number of recruits â‰¥ 100. A separate stream is responsible for a part of the order of at least 50 recruits.

## Part 2:
### Task:
**Topic:**
Using the standard library

**Task:**
Create an application with four threads. Every thread is running
with its own line. Strings can contain only A, B, C, D characters.
A thread can change the character A to C or C to A or B to D or D to B. 
Threads stop when the total number of A and B characters becomes equal for at least three lines.

## Part 3:
### Task:
**Topic:**
Using Golang

**Task:**
Create an application with three threads. Each thread works with its own array, 
the threads check the sum of the elements of their array with the sums of the elements of other threads and stop when 
all three sums are equal to each other. If the sums are not equal, each thread adds one to one element of the array or 
subtracts one from one element of the array, then retests the sums for equality. At the moment of stopping all three 
streams, the sums of array elements must be the same.
